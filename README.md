# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚀

This **Car Price Prediction Model** is my second internship task for **CodeAlpha**. This project uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict the resale price of cars based on various parameters like fuel type, kilometers driven, transmission type, and more. It's a demonstration of my skills in **data science** and **machine learning** with the goal of providing accurate car price predictions! 🎯
## 🌟 Project Overview

In this project, I've implemented four machine learning models:


**Linear Regression**

**Random Forest**

**Gradient Boosting**

**XGBoost**

The best-performing model is then used to predict car prices based on user inputs.
## 🚀 Features
Predict car prices based on **7 parameters**.

**Easy-to-use** GUI for prediction (can be integrated in Google Colab).

**Accurate** predictions with high R2 score. 📊

Models trained using **real-world car data**.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas for data manipulation 📊

Scikit-Learn and XGBoost for machine learning 🤖

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations 📈

Tkinter for GUI
## 🛠️ Approach

**Data Preprocessing**:

The dataset was cleaned and transformed by removing unnecessary features, such as the Year column, and computing the car's age.

Label encoding was applied to convert categorical variables like fuel type, seller type, and transmission into numerical values. 🔢

**Model Selection:**

I trained four models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

The models were compared using the R2 Score to find the best-performing one. 🎯

**Prediction GUI:**

I built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter for user-friendly interaction, where users can input car details and get instant price predictions! 🎨

## 📚 Key Learnings

**Handling Real-World Data**: This project taught me how to handle real-world datasets, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and dealing with missing or incorrect values. 🧹

**Model Comparison**: I learned how to compare multiple models and use performance metrics like R2 score to determine the best-performing model. 📈

**GUI Development**: Building a simple but functional GUI in Python was a new challenge, which enhanced my understanding of integrating ML models with user interfaces. 💻

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: I explored how to fine-tune machine learning models for optimal performance, especially for complex models like XGBoost. 🛠️

## 🏆 Results
After testing and evaluating the models, here are the **R2 scores** for each:

Linear Regression: 0.85

Random Forest: 0.92

Gradient Boosting: 0.91

XGBoost: 0.93

The **XGBoost model** gave the highest accuracy with an **R2 score of 0.93**, making it the most reliable for car price prediction in this project! 🎉
